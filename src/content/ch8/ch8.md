The Semantic Web is still an open research area, nonetheless companies willing to apply such technologies to the business world are showing up on the market at a rapidly growing pace. Among these enterprises stands Mondeca, which is a leading provider of software based on semantic technologies, focusing on adapting their products to the needs of companies and business models. The next step is, then, consolidating modern knowledge coming from the areas of web design, user experience and data visualization, in order to enable consumption of the information coming out of these software, in a way that can suit both technical experts and domain experts, that may be not that familiar with taxonomies or entities. 

The success of this project, indeed, may be identified in the connection the CAM application establishes between these two separate worlds: on one hand, text mining and content augmentation processes are exploited to deliver valuable information: this means that the full potential of modern techniques and complex algorithms can be put in place, with the goal of continuously improving the offer of services and insights that may be extracted from pieces of content, documents, tweets, and so on; on the other hand, design and visualization principles are applied in order to create a meaningful and clear dashboard; in addition to this, drawing from the wide area of Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience, the resulting application succeeds in supporting users to complete their activities of both analyzing the detected entities and relationships, and reviewing such annotations, by confirming, deleting and adding them as needed.

In other words, the two domains of expertise collide in the development of a product that may be competitive, feature-rich and human-sized.
