At this point, the “review” screen was still lacking a couple of fundamental features: a way to submit the modifications and store them on the server, and the possibility to find a tag in the document and easily see its details in the table. A usability problem that I spotted in the old version of CAM was the complete lack of a system to undo just executed actions or rollback past decisions (in other words, to change one’s mind). For instance, when the user deletes a tag, it simply disappears from the application and there’s no way to restore it; or if she adds a couple, they get lost in the midst of the possibly very long list of tags. Finally, by hitting a “done” button, the user would cause an automatic process of storing the modifications, no way back. By analyzing such a situation, I immediately thought of an useful parallel with the shopping carts in e-shopping websites: when you go on Amazon.com, there is no way you can accidently end up buying something you didn’t want, nor it happens that you leave an item out of your order. This is mostly due to the last step of the purchasing process, represented by the shopping cart, which summarizes all the details, the items you are about to shop, prices, and so on; in addition, there’s some confirmation action required in order to proceed further with the order. 
The way I see CAM is greatly linked to this scenario: CAM’s users decide among a catalogue of tags which ones they want, which ones the would discard, and they can even “buy” some tags that are not present in the catalogue itself. Therefore, my suggestion is to add a simple “summary” step, in which the users are presented with a list of the modifications that are about to be permanently stored, with the option to roll back and change their minds.
