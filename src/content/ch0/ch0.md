In the ever expanding Web of data, content is quickly becoming more important than software itself. In such a context, the capability of giving meaning to unstructured data is more and more fundamental to big and small enterprises, which benefit greatly by the possibility to browse and discover their corporate knowledge, while enforcing internal logic or guidelines. As the need for meaning and structure grows, a partially new challenge opens up for UI designers and data visualization experts: creating applications capable of exposing in a clear and meaningful way the real and valuable _content_ contained in the midst of unstructured data, hopefully supporting further reasoning or action over the conveyed information. At Mondeca, which is a leading provider of software based on semantic technologies, indeed, both areas collide as they aim at providing to their customers both the services and related web UIs, with the goal of _Making Sense of Content_, as the company's motto states. It is precisely this what we did as an internship project: in the present work it is described the experience and lessons learned while designing and developing a web application for the Content Annotation Manager, a tool aiming at analyzing and reviewing the process of text mining and content augmentation performed by Mondeca's technologies. The challenges faced include designing a usable product adopting a user-centered approach, developing a dynamic web application with modern technologies, making the most out of today's performance models and strategies to deliver a great experience, and expanding back-end's capabilities.
