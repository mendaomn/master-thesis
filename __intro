An Introduction "introduce" the reader to your work, the main results and how to read your work
[12:05:26] Ghislain Atemezing: It's like a summary of your work
[12:05:36] Ghislain Atemezing: with the name "Introduction"
[12:05:58] Ghislain Atemezing: That's way it's recommended to write it at the very end
[12:06:18] Ghislain Atemezing: It's not an easy task but a good exercise of writing :)
[12:06:52] Ghislain Atemezing: Someone can just read the introduction and the conclusion.. and be able to understand the key elements of your work
conclusion= take away message + future work

in the conclusions one does not talk about "the final result is good but could be better", but rather a take away message like "good UIs for semantic are possibile and much can be learned by my experience"
[12:11:39] Alessandro Menduni: is that what you were suggesting?
[12:13:56] Ghislain Atemezing: more or less.. I would say sth like "good UIs for semantic apps are possible because I was able during my intern to 1- create a UI for CAM 2- optimize the user experience, etc.."

in the introduction, should I explain that it was an internship related to my double degree, or should I just explain what I worked on at mondeca and why?
[12:16:57] Ghislain Atemezing: Yeah.. you can briefly said that (details in chapter 1) - the context (general), the environment (CAM/Mondeca), the objective  and introduce the rest of the chapters (structure of your work) to the readers.
